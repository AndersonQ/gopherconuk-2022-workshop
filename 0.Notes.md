 - You should debug with the tools you have available in prod 
 - Debuggers run bugs ins slow motion, they don't find them
 - Debuggers are to understand a code base
 - Precision based semantics
 - The avg person cannot keep more than 5 things in their had at the same time
 - The agv dev cannot keep a mental model of the code base, we can keep a mental model of at most 10k lines of code
 - Engineering sia bout the costs of the decisions
 - Keep it simple until you cannot
 - Make things easier to understand, not easier to do
 - Best to layer, don't group


** App layer
 - start/stop
 - external output
 
** Business
 - Solves the business problem
 - should no tbe imported by others

** Foundation
 - almost like the std lib for the project
 - they might become a lib for multiple projects
 - no package under foundation is allowed to lock, don't force anything like a logger or so
 - imports only go down, never up

** zart - that brown paper thing we put on a cup to do not burn ourselves
 - container and related config
 
** logging
 - don't use singletons
 - don't hide loggers in the context
 - you need the logs to be what you're used to in dev mode, they need to tall everything.
   - No, oh let's increase the log level and wait the bug to happen again
 

 - commit to a db/cloud whatever instead of creating abstractions to one day, that
 never come, change to another implementation.
 - packages should provide, not contain
   - how can you see pkg that provides X contains
     - the package should have a file names after the package
 - only main should read configurations
 - default config works 100% of the time to dev
   - keys should be the only roadblocks
 - don't have orphan goroutines, if the parent needs to end, a foster parent must be found
 - have a comment section on top of main() with a list of ALL TODOs
 - return concrete types, take in interface. Returning an interface causes allocation
 - state in the context to maintain, debug 
 - in foundation  -> policy across the board
 - in business -> specific to the app/service/small context
